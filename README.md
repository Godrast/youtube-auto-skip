# youtube-auto-skip

Unpacked extension for modern browsers that will automatically close banners and skip ads played on youtube videos. It works by automatically clicking on the X button on banners or skip button on the ads - as if you were to move your mouse and click it yourself

I created it as an alternative for myself so I can support the people that I watch without the inconvinience of having to do anything to skip the ads

If I'm not lazy, I'll make some settings that allow for choosing between working only in forground (will be slightly better for performance) and working in background too - which is how it currently works
